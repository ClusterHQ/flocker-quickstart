Flocker Quickstart Files
========================

Configuration files in this repository are used to deploy demo applications in Flocker's `Getting Started guide`_.

Flocker is a data volume manager and multi-host Docker cluster management tool, which is being developed by `ClusterHQ`_.
With it you can control your data using the same tools you use for your stateless applications.
This means that you can run your databases, queues and key-value stores in Docker and move them around as easily as the rest of your app.
